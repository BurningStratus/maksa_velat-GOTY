The first thing you do after arriving back in Monaco is finding the "Ice cream truck driver" you owed the money to and
hand over the money. They give off a devious smirk and let you pick an ice cream from the truck as a sign of good will.
Or so you thought... You get home and notice that no one is home and there is a letter for you on the table.
The letter reads:

" We've waited for your debt for long enough. By the time you read this it's likely that you've paid it off,
but that just doesn't cut it anymore.
We've taken your love interest. They were very willing to follow once they learned about your debt.
Call it a late fee if you will. They'll prove their usefulness in time.
Wish to save them? Fork over the late fees. Good luck! "

You rush back to the ice cream truck driver's house and peer through the windows.
You see your significant other inside making ice cream.
Just as you do, the truck driver notices you and tells you to get off his property unless you're about to pay them.
They let out a roaring laugh at your defeated look as you leave, determined to right this wrong.
It looks like our troubles with money aren't quite over...
