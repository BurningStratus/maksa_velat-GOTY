########## Maksa_Velat projekt ############

This game is made by using Python 3 programming language
and SQL databases.

Commands are used for the game's controls.
Typically it is recommended to wait for terminal to
print all needed data before pressing any buttons.

Text prompt examples are shown in boxes below
representing how commands look like in an
actual game.

When the game shows the prompt:
+============================+
|[game prompt] Y/N:          |
+============================+

Y(y) will mean "Yes" and N(n) Will mean "No".

When the game prompts [ENTER], it means that you should press Enter.
(contextually)
+-----------------------+
|Wanna gamble? [ENTER]/N|
+-----------------------+

In the example above, press enter to play Black Jack.
If N is entered, you won't play Black Jack.

You have 2 primary parameters to follow:
Your money, and Your Debt.

Your money amount at the start of the game is always 500$.
Debt amount is determined by the player at the start of the game(but no longer than 11 symbols).
So, the player can define the difficulty level themselves.

// TRAVELING AROUND THE WORLD:
At every airport, you will have 9 different cities to travel to.
Each flight costs you 50$.
(except for situations when you have free 300 L of aviation fuel).

To win the game, you will have to earn enough money
to pay off the debt and return to Monaco.

To travel to another city, type the code of the city.
+============================+
|Your money amount: 1000 $   |
|Your Debt: 5000 $           |
|Where you would like to fly?|
|                            |
|(BE) Bern, Switzerland      |
|(RO) Rome, Italy            |
|(BA) Barcelona, Spain       |
|(WA) Warsaw, Poland         |
|(PA) Paris, France          |
|(VI) Vienna, Austria        |
|                            |
|> BE                        |
+============================+
If you type BE, just like in the example above,
you will travel to Bern, Switzerland.

// Blackjack:
At some cities, you will have the opportunity to play Black Jack
at illegal casinos. That's the only way you know how to make money.
+===================================+
|Do you want to play blackjack? Y/N |
+===================================+
To play Black jack, type Y(y).

You are only allowed to play 3 hands of Black Jack at the same casino at a time.

Blackjack features "previous bet memory".

When you have played at least one hand, press ENTER when the game prompts for a bet
to use the previous one. If you press ENTER on your first hand
however, the bet will be set default, or 20% of your current money capped at 200$.
So, if you have 123$, the default bet will be: 123$ * 0.2 == 25$(always rounded).
But, if you have 3000$, the default bet will be 200$, not 600$.

At the start of each game in casinos, you will be prompted to view rules:
+----------------------------------+
| View rules of Black Jack? Y/N:   |
+----------------------------------+
Type Y(y) to view complete rules of black jack.


// RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

During Your journey around the Europe, you might encounter
"interesting" people and situations. Some of them might be sketchy, so
be cautious.


Oh, and one more thing: good flights!
