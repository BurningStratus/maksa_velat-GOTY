It's spring 1997 in Monaco. Last winter you got into gambling and racked up some debt. Now the local debt collector
"The Ice cream truck driver" has run out of patience and you just haven't hit it big yet. All you have is 500$ and
that's not nearly enough to pay off your debt. You decide to take your small airplane and fly around Europe to play
Blackjack at illegal casinos, since gambling and casinos have worked out so well for you so far. But this time you're
confident you will win back all the money so you can return to Monaco and pay off your debts.  -This time for sure!-
