" We've waited for your debt for long enough. By the time you read this it's likely that you've paid it off,
but that just doesn't cut it anymore.
We've taken your love interest. They were very willing to follow once they learned about your debt.
Call it a late fee if you will. They'll prove their usefulness in time.
Wish to save them? Fork over the late fees. Good luck! "
