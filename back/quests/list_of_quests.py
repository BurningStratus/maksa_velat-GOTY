Plant the trees
In the city you meet a group of young energetic people. 
They are on their way to plant some trees with a local organisation. 
Would you like to join them?

if yes:
You had a nice time with the youngsters and together you planted over a thousand trees. 
Thatâs some good karma! And the afterparty was amazing.

seuraus: ei vaikutusta rahaan, mutta +1 pÃ¤ivÃ¤
----------------------------------

Fundraiser 
On the street you notice a group of people dressed up all fancy. 
They tell you that there is a big fundraiser event  for girlsâ education about to begin and 
the method of raising the funds is blackjack. After hearing that you are basically a blackjack pro, 
they ask you to join them. You are definitely not dressed appropriately. 
But on the other hand you have always been passionate about womenâs rights. Will you join them?

if yes:
In the beginning you placed a bet of 100$ and played better than ever, but of course all the money 
went to charity. It was all worth it because you had a blast and made some new friends.

raha -100$ ja +1 pÃ¤ivÃ¤

Problems with the engine
You have been having some troubles with your airplane's engine. You find a friendly mechanic. 
Luckily they tell you the repairs will cost you only 100$. There is also a chance to convert the engine 
so that it would run on ethanol instead of kerosene. The conversion would cost you only 50$ on top of 
the 100$ for the needed repairs and the ethanol would cost you the same as kerosene(50$ per flight). 
Are you an environmental hero or will you continue to fly with kerosene?

if yes:
The repairs and the conversion cost you 150$. Now your dear plane is running smoothly and 
environmentally friendly :)

raha -150 tai -100

--------------------------------

All quests done:
Congratulations! You have completed three quests to make the world a better place: you planted trees, 
gave money to girlsâ education and converted your airplaneâs engine to run on ethanol. 
Your good deeds have been noticed by a big environmental organization and they gave you a stipend of 1500$! 

raha +1500$
