-RULES of BLACKJACK- Winner is the one with the sum of the cards closer to 21.
 In the beginning both the Player and the
Dealer are dealt two cards. One of the Dealer's cards is disclosed until the Player chooses to "Stay". When
the game prompts: " Stay? YES / NO " click 'YES' to stay or 'NO' to take a new card. Player can take as many cards as
they want. Dealer takes new cards until their sum is at least 16. Number cards have their own values. J, Q, K have the
value of 10. Ace has the value of 1 or 11, whichever suits the player best. When player is satisfied with their cards or
"hand", the Dealer opens their second card. If sum of cards is over 21, the player(or Dealer) is "busted" and loses their bet.
If both the Dealer's and the Player's sums are under 21, the one whose sum is closer to 21, wins.
