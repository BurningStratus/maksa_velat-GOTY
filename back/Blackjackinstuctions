-RULES of BLACKJACK- Winner is the one with the sum of the cards closer to 21.
 In the beginning both the Player and the Dealer are dealt two cards. One of the Dealer's cards is
 disclosed until the Player chooses to stay. The Player can take a new card by clicking "HIT". Player can
 take as many cards as they want.
 When player is satisfied with their cards or "hand", they click "STAY" and the Dealer opens their second card.
 Dealer takes new cards until their sum is at least 16. Number cards have their own values. J, Q, K have the
value of 10. Ace has the value of 1 or 11, whichever suits the player best. If sum of cards is over 21, the
player(or Dealer) is "busted" and loses their bet.
If both the Dealer's and the Player's sums are under 21, the one whose sum is closer to 21, wins.
