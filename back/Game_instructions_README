You have 2 primary parameters to follow: Your money and Your Debt.
The goal of the game is to earn enough money to pay off your debt. You take off on your tiny airplane and travel
around Europe to play Blackjack at illegal casinos. That's what got you into debt in the first place,
but that's also the only way you can make money at the moment.

TRAVEL:
At every airport, you will have 9 different cities to travel to.
Each flight costs you 50$.
You can choose your destination on the list next to the map. Click the buttons next to the cities to travel there.

BLACKJACK:
At some cities, you will have the opportunity to play Blackjack
at illegal casinos. The game prompts:

" Do you want to play blackjack? YES / NO "
To play Blackjack, click 'YES'.

You are allowed to play 3 hands of Blackjack at the same casino at a time. But you can always com back later...

Blackjack features "previous bet memory".

When you have played at least one hand, click 'BET' when the game prompts for a bet
to use the previous one. If you click 'BET' on your first hand
however, the bet will be set default, or 20% of your current money capped at 200$.
So, if you have 123$, the bet will be: 123$ * 0.2 == 25$(always rounded) and if you have 3000 it will be 200$, not 600$.

At the start of each game in casinos, you will be prompted to view rules:

 " View rules of Blackjack? YES / NO "

Click 'YES' to view complete rules of blackjack.

RANDOM ENCOUNTERS:

During Your journey around the Europe, you might encounter
"interesting" people and situations. Some of them might be sketchy, so
be cautious.

Oh, and one more thing: good flights!
