"Stupid cat" - You think.
Do you really need these keys?


IF NO - You let the cat get away with the bunch of your keys. Not that there was anything important, but you are not happy either. // quest denied
IF YES - Your back hurts, and your left hand is scratched. Come on, this keychain isn't worth it to chase it.
But still, will you chase the damn black cat?


IF NO - You let the cat get away with the bunch of your keys. Not that there was anything important, but you are not happy either.
Something tells you that you should have retrieved the keychain. The cat is never to be seen again.

IF YES - After another couple of minutes of exhausting chase, cat finally lets your keys go. You retrieve your keys. But after a long chase,
you are deep inside a foreign city on an unknown street. While walking on the street and cursing the cat, you find 200$.
Maybe that black cat didn't bring bad luck after all. 
Asking people for directions and trying to understand them in a mix of local language and english 
wasn't particularly easy, but in the end you find your way back to the airport.
